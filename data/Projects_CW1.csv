009-000006796,273,9,Department of Health and Human Services,CMS Encounter Data,2045,285833,"Payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are risk adjusted.  MA plans are paid approximately $13 billion per month for the more than 11 million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans.  Improvements in the accuracy of these payments will have a significant impact on the program. The current risk adjustment model is estimated using Fee-For-Service (FFS) cost and diagnoses data. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has shown that patterns in FFS and MA diagnostic data differ in important ways and lead to overpayments to MA plans. Adding health care encounter data to the existing risk adjustment system will improve the accuracy of the risk adjustment model used to pay MA plans by reflecting the appropriate patterns of utilization and costs within the MA program. While establishing a risk adjustment model more appropriate for MA plans is the paramount reason for collecting MA encounter data, there are other important uses of the data that will improve other key functions undertaken by CMS, including: calculation of Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, quality review and improvement activities, and Medicare coverage purposes. Thus, there is a need to properly collect, edits, and store the MA health care data necessary to describe and price a health care encounter; this is in addition to the currently collected, edited and stored diagnosis data.  There is also a need to develop the capability to price the MA health care encounter data to be able to estimate the cost of a Medicare beneficiary enrolled in an MA plan. The EDS project will assist CMS in achieving its agency-wide goal of reaching accurate and predictable payments.  Specifically, those paid through the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug System (MARx). The three main objectives to obtain with the implementation of the EDS project are: Collection and pricing of more than 330 million claims annually supporting 11 million beneficiaries enrolled in the MA program, Obtain reports that reflect true MA beneficiary utilization by 2013, and Providing appropriate data leading to more accurate Risk Adjustment model development by 2015.",6,onTime,2009-01-01T00:00:00Z,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,0,0,45.43,45.43,46.108,-0.678,-1.49,2012-07-23T00:00:00Z,09:41:12,285833
