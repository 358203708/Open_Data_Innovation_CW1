#Open Data Innovation CW1


##Overview

This project is a web application for **COMP6214: Open Data Innovation** coursework#1. Here is [coursework specification](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp6214/2016/Coursework1.pdf).

The website is developed using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). Two data visualisations on this webpage are designed using [DC.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/) and [DataTables](https://www.datatables.net/).

The website is deployed on my ECS [personal homepage](http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/sw9n14/ODI_CW1).

##[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](https://twitter.com/fat), and maintained by the [core team](https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people) with the massive support and involvement of the community.

##[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
Font Awesome is a full suite of 605 pictographic icons for easy scalable vector graphics on websites,
created and maintained by [Dave Gandy](https://twitter.com/davegandy).


##[DC.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)
DC.js is a javascript charting library with native [crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) support and allowing highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional dataset (inspired by crossfilter's demo). It leverages [d3](https://d3js.org/) engine to render charts in css friendly svg format. Charts rendered using dc.js are naturally data driven and reactive therefore providing instant feedback on user's interaction. The main objective of this project is to provide an easy yet powerful javascript library which can be utilized to perform data visualization and analysis in browser as well as on mobile device.

##[DataTables](https://www.datatables.net/)
DataTables is a plug-in for the [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) Javascript library. It is a highly flexible tool, based upon the foundations of progressive enhancement, and will add advanced interaction controls to any HTML table.
